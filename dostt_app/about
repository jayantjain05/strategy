Strategic Analysis for Dostt App! ðŸš€

Recently, I had the opportunity to analyze and present strategies for improving the Dostt App, focusing on user engagement, retention, and monetization. I used Google-Play-Scraper to extract and analyze real user reviews to identify key pain points and opportunities. 

My focus was on: 
âœ… Boosting Average Talk Time
âœ… Solving Night-Time Mismatch
âœ… Converting Users to Superdostts 
âœ… Optimizing Monetization


ðŸ”¹ Tools & Skills Used:

Google-Play-Scraper (Python) â€“ Extracted Play Store reviews for sentiment & behavioral insights

NLP & Sentiment Analysis â€“ Analyzed user feedback to make a word cloud to refine engagement strategies

A/B Testing & User Metrics â€“ Measured call success rates, talk-time trends, and user retention

Push Notification Optimization â€“ Personalized engagement strategies based on user behavior

It was an exciting challenge to dive deep into user engagement strategies, retention metrics, and revenue models. I have attached outcomes based on the analysis and relevant strategies to reduce the pain points for the business.
