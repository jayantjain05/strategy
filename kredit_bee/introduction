üìä EMI-Level Data Analysis & Underwriting Recommendations
Welcome to the EMI-Level Data Analysis project! This repository showcases a comprehensive data-driven approach to analyzing EMI repayment behavior for an international lender and provides actionable insights to improve underwriting practices based on bureau and banking variables.

üöÄ Project Objective
Analyze EMI-level loan data to:

Identify key patterns and drivers of default.
Evaluate the impact of credit bureau and banking variables.
Recommend improvements for underwriting strategies to reduce credit risk and optimize loan approval processes.
üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
The dataset includes:

Loan details: principal amount, tenure, interest rates, disbursal & repayment dates.
Borrower credit behavior: CIBIL scores, inquiries, utilization metrics.
Repayment history: EMI due dates, payment delays, default flags.
Geographical information: borrower region.
Note: Data anonymized for demonstration purposes.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
SQL (for exploratory data analysis - optional)
Excel (for quick descriptive stats - optional)
Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis & visualization)
üîç Key Analyses Performed
Data Preprocessing

Date conversion, handling missing values, feature engineering (days_delayed, emi_amount, default_flag).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Default rates by region.
Distribution of CIBIL scores and utilization ratios.
EMI payment delay patterns.
Feature Correlation Analysis

Identified key drivers of default: principal_outstanding_amt, ABB_90d, Utilization.
Predictive Modeling

Logistic Regression (baseline model).
Random Forest Classifier (improved recall and accuracy).
Addressed class imbalance using stratified sampling and evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
üìà Results & Insights
Default Rate: 13.78% overall; regionally varies.
Top Risk Indicators:
Principal Outstanding Amount
ABB_90d (Average Balance Behavior over 90 days)
Credit Utilization
Model Accuracy:
Logistic Regression: 85% accuracy, poor recall.
Random Forest: 87% accuracy, 38% recall for default class.
Recommendations:
Focus underwriting on high-utilization borrowers.
Implement early intervention strategies for borrowers delaying EMIs by more than 20 days.
Enhance regional risk models.
